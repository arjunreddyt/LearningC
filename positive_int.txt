Positive integers are stored as bit strings similar to how an odometer works in a car with a '-' indicator when there is rollover. It is binary storage with with varying amounts of allotted space. Short Integer has 16 sapces available while Integer and Unsigned Integer have 32 spaces available. Going back to the odometer analogy, once all 16 or 32 spaces are with the binary value 1, with the exception of the initial value, then this is indicitive of that bit string being full. In the case of the Short Integer this occurs at the value 32767 and once the value of 32768 is entered, it reverses the whole binary representation (leading with a 1 followed by 15 0s) and displaying the input of 32768 as '-32768' instead.
   The algorithm used to determine this was simple trial and error while keeping a keen eye on the changes in binary values as different inputs were tested.
   As mentioned above, when increaseing the positive value beyond the number of bits used to store it a '-' will appear indicating the so called 'rollover' of bits
